Installation
============

The quick way (with pip):

::

    pip install icrawler

or (with conda)

::

    conda install -c hellock icrawler

You can also manually install it by

::

    git clone git@github.com:hellock/icrawler.git
    cd icrawler
    python setup.py install

If you fail to install it on Linux, it is probably caused by
*lxml*. See `here <http://lxml.de/installation.html#requirements>`__ for
solutions.
